    "## 1. Understanding Information Entropy\n",
    "**Information entropy**, introduced by Claude Shannon, _is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a set of possible outcomes_. In the context of Wordle, entropy quantifies the expected information you would gain from making a particular guess, based on how it partitions the remaining possible words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Entropy in Wordle?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Wordle, each guess provides feedback that narrows down the list of possible answers. By choosing a word that maximizes the expected information gain (entropy), you can eliminate the largest number of potential words, leading you closer to the solution more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Probability Distribution:** The likelihood of each possible outcome.\n",
    "- **Expected Information Gain:** The average amount of information you expect to gain from a guess.\n",

    "## 2. Applying Entropy to Wordle\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Calculate Entropy for a Guess**\n",
    "1. Possible Outcomes: For each guess, consider all possible feedback patterns (e.g., positions of green, yellow, and gray letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Partitioning the Word List: Each feedback pattern partitions the remaining possible words into subsets. Words that would produce the same feedback form a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculating Probabilities: For each feedback pattern, calculate the probability that it will occur, based on the current list of possible answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Entropy Formula:\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\text { Entropy }=-\\sum_i p_i \\log _2 p_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $p_i$ is the probability of the $i$-th feedback pattern.\n"
