## Quickstart

Install the pre-commit hooks for formatting code:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Install packages to the .venv:

```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the package in "editable" mode, which means changes to the Python files will be immediately available without needing to reinstall the package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```
