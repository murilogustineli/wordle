    "The datasets were chosen because of their interesting characteristics, such as heterogeneous columns, numerical features, no missing data, and similar class distribution while having different dimensionality sizes.\n",
    "The Breast Cancer dataset contains 569 instances and 31 features, with each example labeled as either malignant or benign using a binary target variable. The distribution of the target classes is uneven, with 357 examples being benign and 212 being malignant.\n",
    "Meanwhile, the Wine dataset was created by combining the red wine and white wine datasets from the Wine Quality UCI repository. A binary target variable was created based on the type of wine, with 0 indicating white wines and 1 indicating red wines. The final wine dataset has 6,497 instances and 13 features. The distribution of the target classes is also uneven, with 4,898 examples as white wine and 1,599 as red wine.\n",

    "In unsupervised learning tasks, choosing the best number of clusters is a crucial step in improving generalization as there\n",
    "are no labels to predict.\n",
    "KMeans and EM are two popular clustering algorithms that share the same objective: finding groups of data based on their similarity.\n",
    "KMeans is centroid-based and partitions data into a pre-determined K number of clusters.\n",
    "It works by randomly selecting K centroids, assigning each data point to its nearest centroid, and adjusting the centroids towards the mean of the data points.\n",
    "This process is repeated until the centroids no longer move, indicating convergence.\n",
    "On the other hand, EM is a probabilistic clustering algorithm that finds the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a mixture model that best fits the data.\n",
    "It works by randomly initializing the parameters of the mixture model, then it iteratively performs two steps until convergence.\n",
    "First, instances are assigned to clusters (referred to as the \"expectation step\").\n",
    "Second, the clusters are updated (called the \"maximization step\").\n",
    "In the expectation step, each instance in the dataset is assigned a probability of belonging to each cluster based on the current cluster parameters.\n",
    "In the maximization step, the clusters are updated using all the instances in the dataset, with each instance weighted by the probability that it belongs to that cluster.\n",
    "The update of each cluster is mainly influenced by the instances that it is most responsible for \\cite{Geron}.\n",

    "The best number of K clusters was chosen in an unsupervised manner for both algorithms.\n",
    "For KMeans, the silhouette score was used as the performance measure for choosing K.\n",
    "The silhouette score defined as the mean silhouette coefficient over all instances, and its bounded between -1 and +1.\n",
    "It measures the quality of the clustering by considering cluster density (the distance between the data points within a cluster) and separation (how far apart the clusters are from one another).\n",
    "Mutual information measures the amount of information shared by two variables and it was used to validate the best K value.\n",
    "According to the silhouette score, the best number of clusters for the Breast Cancer dataset was determined as K=4 (Figures 1 and 2).\n",
    "Even though other K values have higher silhouette scores, such as K=2 or K=3, most of the instances in those clusters have lower coefficients than this score, stopping short on the left side of the dashed line (Figure 2).\n",
    "Thus, when K=4 and 5, all the clusters extend beyond to the right of the dashed red line (Figure 2), indicating the clusters coefficients are higher than the mean silhouette score.\n",
    "Although K=4 and 5 are possible choices, when K=4 all clusters have similar sizes as compared to K=5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar results were observed for the Wine dataset.\n",
    "The best number of clusters was chosen using the silhouette score where K=4 (Figures 3 and 4).\n",
    "Since both Breast Cancer and Wine are binary classification datasets, the number of chosen clusters did not line up with the original labels.\n",
